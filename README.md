## Abstract
Gravitational waves have been detected by the interferometers LIGO and VIRGO in 2015 thanks to the observation of merging black holes in binary systems. The study of these objects and their dynamics is therefore fundamental in order to understand how gravitational waves form and to improve the forthcoming detections. In this project we studied the dynamics of star clusters in 83 simulations in a time interval of 100 Mys, with particular focus on black holes and their behavior in binary systems.

## Content

**`pkg_g19`** folder is the python package containing all the useful functions.
